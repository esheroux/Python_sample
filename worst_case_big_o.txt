Worst Case Big O Notation

Task0.py
Regardless of the size of the data file we always pull only one value in so big O is O(1)
The answer is O(1)

Task1.py
Big O for the first for loop is n and for the second is n so we have O(2n) when the data set gets really big, O(2n) simplifies to O(n).
The answer is O(n)

Task2.py
Big O for the for loop is n. The if statements would add a multiplier to n, eg 2n, but as n gets large, 2n simplifies to n. 
The answer is O(n)

Task3.py
Big O for the for loop is n. The if statements would add a multiplier to n, eg 2n, but as n gets large, 2n simplifies to n. 
The answer is O(n)

Task4.py
Big O for the for loop is n. The if statements would add a multiplier to n, eg 2n, but as n gets large, 2n simplifies to n. 
The answer is O(n)
